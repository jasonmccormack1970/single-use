Definition
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), the first of the five principles of SOLID, is a fundamental concept in object-oriented software development.
This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should be responsible for only one part of the softwareâ€™s functionality.
You should apply this principle not only to classes but also to functions, modules, etc.

import { OrderService, OrderProcessor, OrderRepository, CustomerNotifier } from "./order-service-classes";

// USAGE
const orderProcessor = new OrderProcessor();
const orderRepository = new OrderRepository();
const customerNotifier = new CustomerNotifier();
const orderService = new OrderService(orderProcessor, orderRepository, customerNotifier);

const order = { id: 1, item: 'Book', quantity: 2 } as Order;
orderService.processOrder(order);


function SR

import * as user from "./handleUserOperations"

USAGE
user.handleUserOperations('user123');
